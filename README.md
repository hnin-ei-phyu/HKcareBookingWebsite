After a long break due to different kinds of situations, I am back to practice my coding again. This is my first project call HKcare which is a hospital booking website after a long break. #Credit to @GreatStack and Thank you for sharing many valuable projects and videos. I am building this project by following project tutorial from Youtube channel "https://www.youtube.com/@GreatStackDev" by @greatstack.
